# Just Cats

## Why does the project exist
One of the steps throughout the selection process for the Associate Software Engineer vacancy in ClearBank Ltd is making a website by using some data on catAPI.

## How to use it
Just download the file from this repo and open the index.html file. The page will serve you with an enormous number of cats picture. Meanwhile, you can select a picture you really like by clicking the favourite button and surely can undo it with a undo button click. You can see your favourite by pressing the my pick button on the navigation bar.
